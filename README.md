This project is something I consider a lifelong and stepping-stone project 
as I'll utilize this app in the future just as I slowly improve it.

Usually, a mature muslim app offers more features such as 
the direction where muslims prays(qibla) which requires 
gyroscope, push notification when their prayer time is up, 
and larger span of prayer times for incoming days as well. 
There are also other features like the quran, however they 
are considered extras. Quran itself is a wholly different 
concept.

The reason behind the development of this project is caused 
by the irritating amount of advertisments bombarding the app. 
There is also another reason which is personal and that is I 
disagree with charging users for trying to use the app. I don't 
find it morally right to reject a service just because someone 
couldn't pay me for my service especially when the service involves 
religious reasons. I believe that every religious acts should be 
charity and not to be monetized as business. 

I understand that developing and maintaining an app might require 
a significant amount of effort and time and developers feel that 
they should derserve some rewards for them to make a living. 
However, I still believe within the concept of islam, there is a 
reward greater than money when you're giving charity and every 
muslim would know how much greater the rewards are with charity.
Thus, it is morally wrong to monetized religious services.
However, developers may accept donation to compensate their effort as 
it is not a form of business but a charity.

After giving some thoughts, I decided to develop an open source 
progressive web app which is something other muslim app hasn't 
done, yet. The app itself would function just as any other muslim 
apps with the exception of bombarding users with ads and that itself 
is sufficient with its selling point. 

How the project would survive? Being open source itself, other 
developers can help contribute to the project not as a living 
but as charity to other users. There are billions of muslims 
around the world and possibly enough that are developers to help 
contribute this project. While they improve the app, developers 
themselves would also benefit as they themselves would use the 
app with the newfound features that they developed.


**2020/08/10 Version Alpha**

Currently, the project itself isn't feature-rich as the 
developer behind it is still new to web development.
Essentially, the web app addresses its core function 
which is to display the list of prayer times relevant 
to the user's location as well as the current date. 
In this phase, new features and ideas are being explored 
and tested.

**Run (in development mode)**
