    <p>
        Adhina is a web app for accompanying muslims around the 
        world to as personal assitant their daily essential needs. 
        Getting reminded of the prayer times is one of them. This project was
        developed to serve its users strictly without any advertisment for 
        smooth user experience.
    </p>
    <p>
        As of now, since this project is one-man job, its features are currently limited. Therefore the focused features 
        addresses on essentials such as notifying the prayer times. Grdually, other features such as qibla, prayer logs as  
        well as many more will be implemented. 
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the policy of this project is that it's
        against ads so that means you can expect to 
        use without getting harrassed with ads. Also, you will  
        always have the access of the features from the app.
        Unlike some others, you'd have to pay to unlock some features
        of the app such as the upcoming prayer time.
        This service will never operate with the intention of 
        monetization.
        After all, every religious act should be with the 
        intention of giving charity.
